# Look_and_Say
This project is a great sample of Data Algorithms example.

This Algorithm is designed to get a number and convert it to another number as if someone is reading the
sequence of digits. For instance: first number is equal to 23; the algorithm converts it to: 'one 2 one 3' or in other words the new number is goanna be 1213
Second Example: if the first number is 11221, the converted number would be: 'two 1, two 2, one 1' ---> 212211
